## Knowledge test

Through a knowledge test, we assess whether you have the necessary knowledge and experience to trade with various financial products. Nordnet is obliged by law to make an assessment of whether the financial products you wish to trade with are suitable for you. It is therefore important, both for you and for us, that you answer truthfully and to the best of your ability to the questions asked in the knowledge test. If you do not complete the knowledge test, you will not be able to trade with the financial products to which the test relates. You can choose to answer the questions in advance or when placing the order. If you attempt to trade a financial product belonging to a group for which you are not qualified, your order will not be executed.
